 Checking the performance of the simulated roulette system:

1️.Monitor outcome frequency:

If the simulated roulette shows unusually high frequency for any single number, color (red/black), parity (even/odd), range (low/high), column, or dozen, this indicates unrealistic bias.

In such cases, modify the simulation to impose limits or corrections to maintain realistic, fair distributions—just as real casinos ensure fairness through auditing and mechanical/algorithmic controls.

2️.Betting policy restrictions:

In real-world casinos, there are strict rules on bet progression systems and maximum betting limits to manage risk and prevent exploitation.

Similarly, in the simulated environment, we will impose restrictions on betting policies—for example limiting bet doubling or progression to 10, 50, or 100 consecutive times.

This simulates real casino behavior and ensures our reinforcement learning agent learns strategies within practical, realistic constraints.
